INTRO                                                                *go-intro*

Full featured Go development environment support for Vim. vim-go installs
automatically all necessary binaries if they are not found. It comes with
pre-defined sensible settings (like auto gofmt on save), has autocomplete,
snippet support, go toolchain commands, etc... Do not use it with other Go
plugins.

  * Improved Syntax highlighting, such as Functions, Operators, Methods..
  * Auto completion support via `gocode`
  * Better `gofmt` on save, keeps cursor position and doesn't break your undo
    history
  * Go to symbol/declaration with `godef`
  * Automatically import packages via `goimports`
  * Compile and `go build` your package, install it with `go install`
  * `go run` quickly your current file/files
  * Run `go test` and see any errors in quickfix window
  * Lint your code with `golint`
  * Run your code trough `go vet` to catch static errors.
  * Advanced source analysis tool with `oracle`
  * List all source files and dependencies
  * Checking with `errcheck` for unchecked errors.
  * Integrated and improved snippets. Supports `ultisnips` or `neosnippet`
  * Share your current code to play.golang.org

INSTALL                                                           *go-install*

If you use pathogen, just clone it into your bundle directory: >

	$ cd ~/.vim/bundle
	$ git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git
<
For the first Vim start it will try to download and install all necessary go
binaries. To disable this behaviour please check out |go-settings|.

Autocompletion is enabled by default via `<C-x><C-o>`, to get real-time
completion (completion by type) install YCM: >

	$ cd ~/.vim/bundle
	$ git clone https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe.git
	$ cd YouCompleteMe
	$ ./install.sh

COMMANDS                                                          *go-commands*

                                                                  *:GoImport*
:GoImport [path]

    Import ensures that the provided package {path} is imported in the current
    Go buffer, using proper style and ordering.  If {path} is already being
    imported, an error will be displayed and the buffer will be untouched.

                                                                *:GoImportAs*
:GoImportAs [localname] [path]

    Same as Import, but uses a custom local name for the package.

                                                                    *:GoDrop*
:GoDrop [path]

    Remove the import line for the provided package {path}, if present in the
    current Go buffer.  If {path} is not being imported, an error will be
    displayed and the buffer will be untouched.

                                                        *:GoDisableGoimports*
:GoDisableGoimports

    Disable goimports and use "fmt" for |:GoFmt| command

                                                         *:GoEnableGoimports*
:GoEnableGoimports

    Enable goimports and use "goimports" for |:GoFmt| command

                                                                    *:GoLint*
:GoLint

    Run golint for the current Go file.

                                                                     *:GoDoc*
:GoDoc [word]

    Open the relevant GoDoc for either the word[s] passed to the command or
    the, by default, the word under the cursor.

                                                                     *:GoFmt*
:GoFmt

    Filter the current Go buffer through gofmt.  It tries to preserve cursor
    position and avoids replacing the buffer with stderr output.

                                                                     *:GoPlay*
:[range]GoPlay

    Share snippet to play.golang.org. If no [range] is given it shares
    the whole file, otherwise the selected lines are shared. Snippet URL
    is copied to system clipboard if Vim is compiled with 'clipboard' or
     'xterm-clipboard' otherwise it's get yanked into the `""` register.

                                                                     *:GoVet*
:GoVet

    Run `go vet` for the directory under your current file. Vet examines Go
    source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose
    arguments do not align with the format string. Vet uses heuristics that do not
    guarantee all reports are genuine problems, but it can find errors not caught
    by the compilers.

                                                                     *:GoDef*
:GoDef [identifier]

    Goto declaration/definition for the given [identifier]. If no argument is
    given, it will jump to the declaration under the cursor.

:GoRun [expand]

    Build and run your current main package. By default all main files for the
    current file is used. An argument that is passed to |expand| can be used as
    file selector. For example use `:Gorun %` to select the current file only.

                                                                   *:GoBuild*

As always one is free to create more advanced mappings or functions based
with |go-commands|. Available <Plug> keys are:
