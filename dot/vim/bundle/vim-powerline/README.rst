Powerline for vim
=================

**The old vim-powerline project is deprecated and is no longer officially 
supported. It will still be available in its current state in this repo 
(checkout the develop branch to continue using it), but it is strongly 
recommended that you migrate to the new project.**

This branch will load the `new Powerline plugin`_ for compatibility with vim 
plugin managers like Pathogen/Vundle.

**IMPORTANT:** This branch does not contain any plugin code, it's only 
a "convenience" branch for usage with Pathogen/Vundle! You need to install 
the `new Powerline plugin`_ as a Python package for this branch to work.  
Please consult the documentation of the new plugin for more information.
